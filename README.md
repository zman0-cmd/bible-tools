# bible-tools
A variety of Bible Tools that are dynamic and easy to use. I can't find a good reading plan generator, so I wanted to have some options for something easy to use and reliable... Also I didn't like anything that I found for what I am working on.

# Under Construction
All of this is a WIP by a single dev who has almost no coding experience. This is gonna be a rocky process. Please submit issues and feature requests. It helps me greatly.


## Projects coming soon:
1) Bible reading plan generator
2) TTS portable
3) More to add soon

Who knows where this will go. Hopefully I can actually see this to completeion.
