# bible-tools
A variety of Bible Tools that are dynamic and easy to use. I can't find a good reading plan generator, so I wanted to have some options for something easy to use and reliable... Also I didn't like anything that I found for what I am working on.

# Under Construction
All of this is a WIP by a single dev who has almost no coding experience. This is gonna be a rocky process. Please submit issues and feature requests. It helps me greatly.

# Updates
Notes on updates

## Update 03/16/25. A few bug fixes, and PDF Generation quickly implemented with jsPDF. I did not refactor the code to include the Math functions as calls to the utils script. Will work on this later when I find some free time.

## Update 03/14/25
Added a custom end date feature to Whole bible. Realized that I call the same math functions in many of my documents and could send that to a seperate function so it could be unified. Will look into this later.

## Update 03/11/25
Initial launch and basic code structure. This code is pretty rough sorry yall.

## Projects coming soon:
1) Bible reading plan generator
2) TTS portable
3) More to add soon

Who knows where this will go. Hopefully I can actually see this to completeion. For now support with issues and code is most appreciated and the only way to support this project.
