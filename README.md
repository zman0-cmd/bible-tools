# open-bible-tools
A Free & Open-Source Toolkit for Bible Study. I can't find a good reading plan generator, so I wanted to have some options for something easy to use and reliable... Also I didn't like anything that I found...

# Under Construction
All of this is a WIP by a single dev who has almost no coding experience. This is gonna be a rocky process. Please submit issues and feature requests. It helps me greatly. I am also using this to learn JavaScript and HTML coding.

# Updates
Notes and updates found on the "dev-blog" at [https://notes.zackmace.com](https://notes.zackmace.com/bible-tools/Reading+Plan+Generator+-+Individual/Dev-updates/OBT%26RPG+-+Dev+Updates)
To be fair its not much of a "blog"

## Projects coming soon:
1) Bible reading plan generator
2) TTS portable
3) More to add soon

Who knows where this will go. Hopefully I can actually see this to completeion. For now support with issues and code is most appreciated and the only way to support this project. Financial Support may be accepted later, but I don't know how or where I will do this yet. Praying and seeking wisdom from others first.
