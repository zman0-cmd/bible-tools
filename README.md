# open-bible-tools
A Free & Open-Source Toolkit for Bible Study. I can't find a good reading plan generator, so I wanted to have some options for something easy to use and reliable... Also I didn't like anything that I found...

# Under Construction
All of this is a WIP by a single dev who has almost no coding experience. This is gonna be a rocky process. Please submit issues and feature requests. It helps me greatly. I am also using this to learn JavaScript and HTML coding.

# Updates
Notes on updates below. dev-blog at https://notes.zackmace.com

## Update 03/16/25. 
- A few bug fixes, and PDF Generation quickly implemented with jsPDF. I did not refactor the code to include the Math functions as calls to the utils script. Will work on this later when I find some free time.

## Update 03/14/25
- Added a custom end date feature to Whole bible. Realized that I call the same math functions in many of my documents and could send that to a seperate function so it could be unified. Will look into this later.

## Update 03/11/25
- Initial launch and basic code structure. This code is pretty rough sorry yall.

## Projects coming soon:
1) Bible reading plan generator
2) TTS portable
3) More to add soon

Who knows where this will go. Hopefully I can actually see this to completeion. For now support with issues and code is most appreciated and the only way to support this project. Financial Support may be accepted later, but I don't know how or where I will do this yet. Praying and seeking wisdom from others first.
